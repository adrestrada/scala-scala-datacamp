Exercise
You can change me
Let's test out a prototype one-player version of Twenty-One. Your friend Alex is . They are dealt two cards: the jack of clubs (J♣) and the ace of diamonds (A♦). They know the default implementation of the game has aces worth 1 point but they want it to be worth 11 so they can add their two cards together to get 21.playerA

In this exercise, you'll code up this scenario. (a with a point value of 10) and (a with a point value of 1) are already defined.jackClubsvalaceDiamondsvar

Instructions
100 XP
Create a named and with the name Alex as a string literal as its value.varplayerA
Change the point value of the ace of diamonds so it is worth 11 points, instead of the original value of 1 point it was assigned.
Add and to calculate the value of Alex's hand and print the result.jackClubsaceDiamonds


// Create a mutable variable for Alex as player A
var playerA: String = "Alex"

// Change the point value of A♦ from 1 to 11
val aceDiamonds: Int = 11
// Calculate hand value for J♣ and A♦
println(jackClubs + aceDiamonds)

playerA: String = "Alex"
aceDiamonds: Int = 11
21
